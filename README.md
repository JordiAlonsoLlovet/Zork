This is a game inspired by the 1977's Zork as well as classic point and click games.
I've removed any RPG or combat elements in favour of puzzle like mechanics, so it is not possible
to die or lose.
The game has a mechanic introduced in the first room that lets you travel between any room and
a version of that same room in the past. Droping or removing items in the past may change
some areas in the present.
